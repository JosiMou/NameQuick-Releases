<h2>Completely Redesigned Settings</h2>
<p></p>
<p>Settings has been rebuilt from the ground up with native macOS styling. The new design features a clean sidebar with six organized categories—General, Appearance, Notifications, AI, Processing, and About—making it faster to find what you need.</p>
<p></p>
<p>**What's new:**</p>
<ul>
<li>**Instant Search** – Press ⌘F to search across all settings. Select a result to jump directly to that setting, highlighted and ready to adjust.</li>
<li>**Keyboard Navigation** – Use ⌘1 through ⌘6 to jump to any category instantly.</li>
<li>**Refreshed AI Provider Cards** – Each provider displays its official logo with clear connection status indicators.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<h2>Also in This Update</h2>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>**More List Columns** – Six new column options: Last Viewed, Created Date, Modified Date, File Size, Tags, and Comments. Choose up to 3 to display.</li>
<li>**API Key Validation Now Tests Real Connectivity** – When you enter an API key for OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, or Ollama, NameQuick now verifies it actually works by making a test connection. You'll see clear status indicators showing whether your key is valid, invalid, or if the service is temporarily unavailable.</li>
</ul>
