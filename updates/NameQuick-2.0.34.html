<h2 id="features">Features</h2>
<ul>
<li>Added a global <strong>Clean filenames</strong> toggle under
Preferences → General &amp; Permissions → Defaults. When enabled,
NameQuick transliterates German umlauts (ä→ae, ö→oe, ü→ue, Ä→Ae, Ö→Oe,
Ü→Ue, ß→ss) and keeps only letters, numbers, single spaces, underscores,
and dashes across Smart Rename, Templates, and Custom Prompt flows.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="improvements">Improvements</h2>
<ul>
<li>Updated the rename preview and documentation to call out the exact
cleanup rules so teams know what stays and what goes before uploading
files.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="fixes">Fixes</h2>
<ul>
<li>Replaced the credit usage queue with a GRDB-backed worker that keeps
retries off the main thread, prevents runaway JSON re-encoding, and
eliminates the high-CPU watchdog terminations some users saw when Polar
was slow.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="cleanup">Cleanup</h2>
<ul>
<li>Removed the deprecated Smart Rename and Basic settings tabs now that
the Craft-style sidebar covers those options.</li>
</ul>
