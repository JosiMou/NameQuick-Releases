Management Made Smoother</h2>
<h2 id="whats-new">### What’s New</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>New queue management popover</strong> – Introducing a
dedicated queue popover where you can view all your queued rename files.
Remove individual items or clear the entire queue with a single
click—everything updates instantly with live badge counts.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="improvements-fixes">Improvements &amp; Fixes</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Editing made stable</strong> – Fixed an issue where the app
would crash when trying to edit your default naming template. You can
now safely customize all your templates without any hiccups.</li>
<li><strong>License management simplified</strong> – Resolved a quirk
where the app would sometimes re-activate itself after you’d reset your
license. Once you unlink your license, it stays unlinked until you
choose to activate it again.</li>
</ul>
