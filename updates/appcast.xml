<p>ðŸ’¡ <strong>Speed up file processing</strong>: Deactivate meta
description generation in settings when not needed. This can
significantly reduce processing time and token usage, especially for
large batches of files. Only enable it when you specifically need
detailed metadata extraction.</p>

keychain permission every 15-30 minutes! NameQuick now runs quietly in
the background without interrupting your workflow.</p>
