Tahoe</h2>
<h3 id="whats-new">What’s New</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Redesigned for macOS Tahoe</strong> – Beautiful new user
interface optimized for Apple’s latest macOS, with modern visual
refinements throughout the app.</li>
<li><strong>Vector artists rejoice</strong> – Drop in AI, SVG, or EPS
files and NameQuick will import, preview, and rename them just like your
photos.</li>
<li><strong>Templates that feel native</strong> – The Templates screen
now looks and behaves like Finder. Quick actions sit right where you
expect them, and the pencil button jumps straight into editing.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="bug-fixes-improvements">Bug Fixes &amp; Improvements</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Memory leak fixed</strong> – Eliminated a critical memory
leak that could cause crashes during extended use—the app now runs
reliably for hours without issues.</li>
<li><strong>Remembers your style</strong> – Fixed persistence
issues—separators, prompts, and other preferences now properly stick
between sessions.</li>
<li><strong>Brackets now allowed</strong> – Fixed filename
sanitization—you can now use bracket characters in generated filenames
without them being stripped out.</li>

overrides not being saved—your selected prompts are now properly
restored when you restart the app.</li>
<li><strong>Clearer UI controls</strong> – Added visible Done button and
Cancel/Save buttons to the custom prompt manager—no more relying on the
Escape key to close dialogs.</li>
<li><strong>Visible dialog buttons</strong> – Fixed invisible button
issue—all confirmation dialogs now show clear Cancel and action buttons
(like the cache-clear dialog).</li>
<li><strong>Instant template edits</strong> – Fixed template editing
behavior—tap the pencil to open the editor, and rename from the context
menu when you really mean it.</li>
<li><strong>Automatic upgrades</strong> – Fixed watch folder
compatibility—existing watch folders pick up vector support
automatically without extra setup.</li>
<li><strong>Stability improvements</strong> – Squashed numerous bugs
affecting app stability and performance.</li>

visual inconsistencies throughout the app.</li>
