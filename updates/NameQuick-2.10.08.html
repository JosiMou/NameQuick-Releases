<h2>Fixes</h2>
<p>  - Fixed a rare issue where subscription credits could stay “stuck” on a device after your billing period renewed or your plan changed. </p>
<p>  - Fixed an issue where custom prompts that analyze screenshots or images would sometimes ignore the visual content and only consider text. These prompts now correctly take the image itself into account when generating results.</p>
