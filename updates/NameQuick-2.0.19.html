<h2 id="v2.0.19-create-your-own-prompts">v2.0.19 — Create Your Own
Prompts</h2>
<p><strong>Your naming rules, automated.</strong></p>
<p>You can now write custom prompts for how you want files renamed. Pick
one from the toolbar, and NameQuick will use it for every file until you
change it. They also work with watch folders for automatic renaming.</p>
<p><strong>Creating a prompt</strong> Settings → AI → Manage Custom
Prompts. Write your instructions like “date first, then project name”
and save. It’ll show up in your toolbar dropdown.</p>
<p><strong>Using prompts</strong> The toolbar dropdown now has three
sections: Smart Rename, Templates, and Custom Prompts. Pick a custom
prompt and the Play button uses it. Switch back to Smart Rename
anytime.</p>
<p><strong>Auto-rename with watch folders</strong> Click on the Can u →
Prompt → pick your custom prompt. New files dropped there automatically
rename using that prompt. The folder chip shows which prompt is
active.</p>
<p><strong>How it works:</strong> - Play button: Uses the prompt shown
in the toolbar - Watch folders: Use their own assigned prompts
(independent of toolbar) - Templates: Override prompts when selected</p>
<p>Simple. Your file naming system, running on autopilot.</p>
<p><strong>Fixes</strong> - Large media drag &amp; drop: Provider‑aware
limits—Gemini supports up to 500 MB (with a quick confirm at 100–500
MB); OpenAI audio above 25 MB is blocked with a helpful tip. -
Templates: Fixed <code>{original}</code> not resolving. File-based
placeholders now work correctly in template renames
(<code>{original}</code>, <code>{extension}</code>,
<code>{parent}</code>, <code>{size}</code>,
<code>{dimensions}</code>).</p>
<p><strong>Known bugs</strong> - Drag &amp; drop not processing the same
file.</p>
