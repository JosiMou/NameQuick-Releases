<ul>
<li><strong>Custom prompts moved to Processing settings.</strong> Find
“Manage Custom Prompts…” inside Settings → Processing ### Bug Fixes</li>
<li><strong>Crash on launch eliminated.</strong> The Accessibility
relaunch prompt now always runs on the main actor, so fresh installs and
permission changes no longer trip a Swift precondition and terminate the
app.</li>
</ul>
