<h1 id="v2.0.31-byok-stability-prompt-manager-refresh">v2.0.31 — BYOK
Stability &amp; Prompt Manager Refresh</h1>
<h2 id="improvements">Improvements</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Claude BYOK pacing</strong> – Batch rename jobs
automatically throttle requests so you can push more files without
tripping Anthropic’s burst limits or seeing 429 errors.</li>
<li><strong>Managed prompt creation</strong> – Fixed a crash that
occurred when Managed (Plug &amp; Play) subscribers pressed “New
Prompt.” The add/edit form now opens inline instead of stacking a second
sheet, so the <code>NSWindowAlreadyHasSheetException</code> path is
gone.</li>
<li><strong>Watch folder stability</strong> – Eliminated duplicate
watch-folder entries that caused <code>_MergeError</code> crashes at
launch, especially on macOS Sequoia. Saved profiles are cleaned
automatically and add/remove now handle path variants safely.</li>
</ul>
