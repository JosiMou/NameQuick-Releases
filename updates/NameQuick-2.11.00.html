<h2>What's New</h2>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>**Try NameQuick Free with Your Own API Key** – New users can now try NameQuick free for 14 days using their own OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, or Ollama API key. The trial includes a set number of AI-powered renames to help you evaluate the app before committing.</li>
<li>**Subscription Trials for New Customers** – If you prefer not to use your own API key, you can now start a free trial of our managed AI service. Existing customers returning after a break will see a welcome-back flow that recognizes their account.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<h2>Improvements</h2>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>**Faster, More Memory-Efficient Image Processing** – Renamed files containing images now process more efficiently with lower memory usage. Large batches of screenshots and photos should no longer cause slowdowns or high memory consumption.</li>
<li>**More Reliable Gemini Integration** – Files that Gemini cannot process (due to content restrictions) now display a clear error message instead of retrying silently. Credits are only charged when a rename actually succeeds.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<h2>Fixes</h2>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue where upgrading from a trial to a subscription didn't immediately reflect in the app, showing stale "trial" indicators until restart.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where purchased BYOK (Bring Your Own Key) licenses were incorrectly shown trial-related UI elements.</li>
<li>Trial periods now use server-verified time to ensure accurate expiration regardless of system clock settings.</li>
<li>Fixed unnecessary complexity in AI responses by only including the internal rule log field when templates actually use transformation rules.</li>
<li>Fixed a template bug where previously working templates broke. These should be stable now. </li>
</ul>
