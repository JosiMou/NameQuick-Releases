<ul>
<li><p>Smarter duplicate-name handling: when a target filename already
exists, NameQuick now automatically appends a counter (e.g., ” (2)“) and
completes the rename, instead of showing a”file already exists” error.
This keeps your flow uninterrupted and preserves the original
extension.</p></li>
<li><p>Gemini model updates (current + compatible): the selector now
shows the latest 2.5 and 2.0 language models that work with NameQuick’s
generateContent flow, and removes legacy/unsupported entries.</p>
<ul>
<li>Added: Gemini 2.5 Pro, 2.5 Flash, 2.5 Flash‑Lite, 2.5 Flash‑Lite
(Preview 09‑2025); Gemini 2.0 Flash, 2.0 Flash‑Lite, 2.0 Flash
(Experimental).</li>
<li>Removed: Gemini 1.5/1.0 families, Live‑only, and TTS models (not
compatible with this flow).</li>
<li>Automatic migration: if you previously selected a removed model
(e.g., 1.5/1.0, Live preview, old Flash‑Lite preview ID), you’ll switch
to the closest 2.5 equivalent on launch and in the selector.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Friendlier error messages: if a template can’t be satisfied
(e.g., missing required fields), the message explains what to change
(relax rules, add examples, or try Smart Rename) instead of a generic
contract violation.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Notes - “Free/Paid” in the Gemini selector means the model offers a
free tier but may bill beyond free quota depending on your Google
account usage. - If you had a 1.5/1.0 model selected, you’ll be moved to
a 2.5 equivalent automatically.</p>
