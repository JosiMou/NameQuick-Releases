<ul>
<li><strong>Never fall back to BYOK for managed accounts.</strong> If
we’re momentarily offline from Polar, NameQuick now keeps your Managed
AI license active, works from cached access, and automatically returns
to the managed Gemini service once reconnected.</li>
<li><strong>Clear warning and logging when service is offline.</strong>
You’ll see a brief “Managed AI is temporarily offline…” banner if we’re
working from cached access, and the diagnostics log captures the
fallback event so support can diagnose it quickly.</li>
</ul>
