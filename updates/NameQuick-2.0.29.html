<h3 id="bug-fixes">Bug Fixes</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>License activation no longer crashes.</strong> If something
goes wrong while activating, youâ€™ll just see the warning message.</li>
<li><strong>Connectivity validation keeps running.</strong> Skipping a
recent success no longer refreshes the cache, so periodic checks still
execute and catch environment/token issues.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="performance">Performance</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Credit balance sync now surfaces instantly on
launch.</strong> Cached snapshots load immediately while Polar refresh
runs in the background, eliminating the multi-second stall when
reopening the app.</li>
<li><strong>Reduced Polar auth chatter.</strong> Successful connectivity
checks are cached for 10 minutes so relaunches skip the redundant HEAD
request that previously blocked credit syncing.</li>
<li><strong>Faster customer resolution retries.</strong> Background
refreshes reuse cached IDs and only fan out to Polar when metadata
changes, trimming cold-start latency.</li>
</ul>
