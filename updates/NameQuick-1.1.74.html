<p>• Custom Pattern Extraction – Define one‑off or recurring “Dynamic
Patterns” under Settings → Pattern Extraction. – Automatically pull out
named fields (e.g. Invoice Number, Date, Client Name) from screenshots,
PDFs, or images. – Files are renamed according to your pattern (e.g.
{InvoiceNumber}-{Date}.png) with no manual work. – Instant in‑app
preview and error feedback if extraction fails, with a single‑click
retry.</p>
