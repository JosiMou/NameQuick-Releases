<h2>NameQuick 2.1.0</h2>
<p></p>
<p>A fresh start. This release reimagines how you get started with NameQuick and makes the whole experience feel more polished and intuitive.</p>
<h2>New Onboarding Experience</h2>
<p></p>
<p>Getting set up is now smoother than ever. A guided flow walks you through choosing how you want to rename files—whether that's AI-powered Smart Rename, structured Templates, or freeform Custom Prompts.</p>
<p></p>
<h2>Presets</h2>
<p></p>
<p>Templates and Custom Prompts are now unified under Presets, with major upgrades to both:</p>
<p></p>
<p>**Templates** got a complete overhaul:</p>
<ul>
<li>**Visual pattern builder** with drag-and-drop chips that show exactly how your filename will look</li>
<li>**Per-field separators** so you can mix dashes, underscores, and spaces however you need</li>
<li>**Live preview** updates as you build, so you always know what you're getting</li>
<li>**Test your templates** while building and iterate until they're perfect</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>**Custom Prompts** now have a cleaner, more prominent UI that makes them easier to create and manage. </p>
<p></p>
<h2>Smarter Rules</h2>
<p></p>
<p>The rules engine is now easier to use and more powerful:</p>
<ul>
<li>**Card-based layout** makes it simple to see and manage your rules at a glance</li>
<li>**Archive and Trash actions** give you more options beyond just moving files</li>
<li>**Logic operators** let you combine conditions for precise control (AND/OR)</li>
<li>**Date conditions** for rules that trigger based on when files were created or modified</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<h2>Refreshed Design</h2>
<p></p>
<p>The whole app feels cleaner—modern glass-style buttons, smooth sidebar transitions, and polished drop zones throughout.</p>
<p></p>
<p>And much more!! </p>
<p></p>
